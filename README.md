# ScrumMasterBot
### Skype bot to help with management of scrum teams

This bot uses the Bot Builder SDK provided by microsoft and Node.js.

The documentation for this SDK can be found [here.](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/modules/_botbuilder_d_.html)

A useful overview of the key concepts behind use of the SDK and its features can be found [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/nodejs/bot-builder-nodejs-concepts)

Microsoft also provides examples of BotBuilder code [here.](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/Node) I have used these examples extensively in my code.
